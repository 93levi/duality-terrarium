I aim to take the ornate design and ethereal energy of early-2000s flash websites and translate them into a modern framework. Im currently working with Sydney-based fashion label From The 13th to create a digital look-book experience for their new collection that will aim to incorporate this duality.

        <p class="invert-text">
          Last year, I took on the role of Chief Social Media Strategist for Brisbane’s biggest vintage clothing retailer, Brik Market.
          I was tasked with completely reimagining the brand’s social media marketing strategy to expand the online store’s global following. 
          I began with a full UX and trend analysis, deep diving into niche online vintage fashion communities to understand what would resonate most with our target demographic.
          <br><br>
          During my research phase, I identified a highly relevant niche: V-Kei, an archival Japanese fashion subculture that was experiencing a major resurgence online. 
          This trend was generating a lot of excitement in the archive fashion community,
          and with this insight, I set out to create content that felt natural, archival, and culturally authentic, the kind of material our audience might encounter on their feed as a rare cultural artefact from the subculture they were currently exploring.
          <br><br>
          The goal was to build trust in the brand’s cultural capital. 
          Instead of feeling advertised to, users would perceive Brik Market as a genuine tastemaker whose curation reflected this aesthetic they were so eager to learn more about.
          To execute this vision, I launched a content series called <i>Cult Fashion Cinema</i>, highlighting niche art-house films that incorporated V-Kei styling in a lo-fi, archival-feeling format that blended seamlessly into users feeds.
          <br><br>
          After weeks of research, planning, and content development, I published the first video to instagram, focusing on the film <i>Oresama</i>. a piece of media that although relatively unknown, captured the energy of V-Kei perfectly.
          Within hours the post went viral, reaching over 200,000 views in the first week. It has since accumulated 13,000+ likes and 2,400+ shares, in turn super charging click-through rate and bringing in countless new followers to Brik Market, 
          a massive jump from the few thousand views that previous posts were receiving.<br><br>

          This project significantly strengthened my ability to:<br><br>
            ● Forecast and capitalize on emerging trends<br><br>
            ● Understand and analyze online demographics<br><br>
            ● Develop effective social media strategies<br><br>
            ● Increase click-through rates and conversions<br><br>
            ● Drive real growth in reach, followers, and sales
